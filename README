TODO:

- Clean up code, e.g. remove naked ptr, use shared_ptr/unique_ptr.
- Add map from truncated public RSA keys to struct with:
  * full public RSA key
  * private RSA key
  * Bitcoin Tx id
- Convert Unix domain listening socket to normal TCP socket
- Add select() or create new thread/thread pool (server is now sequential,
  i.e. handling only one client at a time)
- Maybe use ECDSA keys from Bitcoin address instead of separate RSA keys.
- How many bits of entropy is needed in RNG for quality keygen?
